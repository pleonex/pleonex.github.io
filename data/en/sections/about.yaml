summary: >
  Born in Granada, Spain, I found my passion about software development and
  start self-learning programming.
  After completing a bachelor in _Electrical Engineering_, I jumped into
  software development positions in Granada and then I moved to Switzerland
  where I currently live.


  During my **career** I've worked in projects related to:
  **distributed systems** with pub/sub protocol **DDS**;
  sport timing and **live TV production**;
  DevOps projects;
  **backend frameworks**;
  and **collaboration workflows**, quality assurance and release management.


  Apart from software development, I was able to grow on **operational skills** by
  having the role of senior technical operator of timing and scoring systems in
  the **Olympic Games at Tokyo 2020 and Winter Olympic Games Beijing 2022**.
  I did setup of network infrastructure, hardware and software and operation of software
  during sport competitions. I was the last level of support engineer helping
  teams to troubleshoot network protocols and software issues in critical moments.


  As a **hobby** I maintain several **open-source projects** and frameworks for
  game **reverse engineering** (ROM hacking) and fan-translations.
  I study and analyze low-level details of game consoles and debug and write
  assembly code (ARM). I help teams to translate video-games acting in a role
  usually known as **_Localization Engineer_**. I make programs to edit proprietary
  formats of text, image, font and audio files.


  I also love to give technical talks at conferences and online.
