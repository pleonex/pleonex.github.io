summary: >
  I originally studied _Electrical Engineering_ in Spain but quickly move into hardware
  and software development.
  I self-studied programming, .NET/C# specifically, and built several open-source
  projects and frameworks for game reverse engineering (ROM Hacking) and fan-translations.
  I also have a deep understanding of networks and protocols, especially on DDS,
  a network distributed message protocol.

  Now I am living in Switzerland, where I spent my free time hiking and traveling.
