      Talk at the DevFest 2018 organized by the GDG Jaén (_Google Developer Group_).
      The presentation is about a Twitter thread I did on July. For a week I was
      figuring out how the game _Pokémon Mistery Dungeon Explorers of Sky_ from
      Nintendo DS generate and validate a kind of password for rescue missions,
      special events and object sharing. It almost a study of the assembly code
      of the game with some notes about the implementation.

      by the group _Interferencias_ in the University of Granada. I talked about
      the security mechanisms like encryption that we can find inside of the

      fan-translations.
