      <description>Data Protection Mechanisms in Video Games Grade: 9.9 / 10
 Electrical Engineering Bachelor dissertation. I researched different video games of Nintendo DS to find out how they were protecting different sensitive content like text, video and audio to avoid modifications and/or access. I documented the different algorithms, their weakness and several recommendations to improve the protection.

      <description>Our team won the challenge!
 As part of a group of four students named Prometheus, we participated in an event organized by our university: University of Granada. We participated in the four edition of the so called Tech Challenge. It was sponsored by the company RTI who proposed the topic of the challenge: &amp;ldquo;create a distributed video system&amp;rdquo;. The goal was to simulate a start-up and create from scratch a prototype ready to go to the market.</description>

      <description>As a member of the GradienWords fan-translation group, I worked in my free time as Localization Engineer to translate from Japanese to Spanish the game: &amp;ldquo;Ni no kuni: Shikkoku no Madoshi&amp;rdquo; for Nintendo DS. In this altruistic project we did reverse engineering in the game to translate all the text and images files as well as edit font files and assembly code.
     Programming:  Create programs to convert text, image, audio and font files in easy formats to edit like XML, TXT, PO, PNG, WAV files.</description>
